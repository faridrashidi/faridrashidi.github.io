  I am a data scientist and researcher working in the field of computational oncology. Currently, I am a fellow at the National Cancer Institute doing research on cancer in Laboratory of Human Carcinogenesis under the supervision of Xin Wei Wang. I received my Ph.D. from Indiana University Bloomington in computer science where I developed computational tools to infer tumor heterogeneity and cancer evolution using single-cell sequencing data. I completed <a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/2701106234/9DF7BC9A827840E5PQ">my Ph.D. thesis</a> as a predoctoral visiting fellow at the National Institutes of Health in Cancer Data Science Laboratory under the supervision of Cenk Sahinalp. I accomplished <a href="http://library.sharif.ir/parvan/resource/444343/یادگیری-پیرایش-دگرسان-از-داده-های-توالی-یابی-آر--ان--ای/&amp;from=search&amp;&amp;query=alternative%20splicing&amp;count=20&amp;execute=true">my Master's thesis</a> at the Sharif University of Technology where I worked on the learning of alternative splicing problems, jointly supervised by Abolfazl Motahari and Hamid Rabiee. I completed <a href="http://digitallib.aut.ac.ir/DL/Search/default.aspx?term=فرید+رشیدی+مهرابادی">my Bachelor's thesis</a> at the Amirkabir University of Technology in Iran. My research interests are in developing novel bioinformatics methods for investigating high-throughput genomics and single-cell sequencing data to understand biological processes, with a particular interest in cancer.
